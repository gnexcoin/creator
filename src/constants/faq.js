        "What is Voilk?",
        "Voilk is a social bank, what that means is, it is a social network where your like has a value, by value we mean, 'actual value in money', and your account has banking features that means you can use your account to post articles, make comments, post photos, chat with friends and also use your account as a bank account, make payments, receive payments with zero transaction charges."

        "How does Voilk work?",
        "Voilk.com is an application that is powered by the Voilk blockchain and VOILK cryptocurrency. It read and write content to the Voilk blockchain, which stores the content in an immutable blockchain ledger, and rewards users for their contributions with digital tokens called VOILK. Every 3 seconds, the Voilk blockchain mints new `1.032 VOILK` tokens and adds them to a community's 'rewards pool'. (You can see how much VOILK is there in the reward pool by visiting properties tab on Voilk Explorer). These tokens are then awarded to users for their contributions, based on the likes/votes that their content receives. Users who hold more tokens in their account as 'Voilk Power' will get to decide where a larger portion of the rewards pool is distributed."

        "How does Voilk differ from other social media websites?",

        "What do I need to do in order to secure my account?",
        "Unlike most social media websites, there is no way to recover your account if you lose your password / owner key! This is why it is extremely important that you save and backup your password somewhere safe. It is strongly recommended that you store an offline copy in case of a hard drive failure or other calamity. Consider digital offline storage, such as an external disk or flash drive, as well as printed paper stored in a fireproof safe. Use a safe deposit box for best redundancy. If you leak your private key to another user or a third-party website, that user or website will have full access to your account. This means they can steal it, as well as the funds inside of it. It is therefore not recommended to enter your private key information with any other user or third-party website. If you believe your account has been compromised, you should change your password/keys right away.Each account has multiple keys, which each have different levels of authority: owner, active, posting, and memo. The information on the different types of keys and their purposes, as well as more information on password and key security, can be found in the section on Security."

If you are posting or using someone else’s content, you must ensure that you have the rights to use the content, and properly reference the sources where you got the material from."],
    ["Is it okay to use random pictures from the internet?", "If you are using an image that is not your own, make sure you are allowed to use the image, and cite the source of the image. Using random pictures from the internet without giving credit is discouraged. You may, however, use photos from “free image” websites such as Pexels.com or Pixabay.com. All photos on Pexels and Pixabay are free for personal and commercial use."],
    ["Where do I report a post or comment that contains plagiarism, spam, or abuse?", "You can report any abusive content to our Discord Group. or make a post about it and use #report_abuse Tag"],
    ["What is Reputation?", "Every user has a reputation score next to their name. The reputation score is one way Voilknetwork measures the amount of value you have brought to the community. It is also a mechanism that is designed to help reduce abuse of the Voilknetwork platform. Your reputation goes up when accounts vote on your content. Getting downvoted by someone with a higher reputation can push your reputation down and make your posts less visible.Users with a lower reputation score are unable to affect your reputation."],
    ["How is the Reputation score measured?", "Every new user starts off with a reputation score of 25. The reputation score is based off of a log10 system, which means that a score of 40 is about 10x better than a score of 30."],
    ["How do I improve my reputation score?", "Every time another user upvotes one of your posts or comments, it increases your reputation score. The more Voilk Power that the voter has, the larger the effect is. The best way to earn upvotes is by adding value to the Voilknetwork community."],
    ["What causes my reputation score to go down?", "The only way for your reputation score to go down is to be downvoted by another user. Not all downvotes will cause a reputation loss though. Downvotes from users with a lower reputation score than you will not hurt your score.If your post or comment that was downvoted still received more upvotes than downvotes (weighted by SP), then the net effect on your reputation score will still be positive."],
    ["Why does my reputation score matter?", "A reputation score is one way Voilknetwork measures the amount of value you have brought to the community. In real estate, they say there are three variables of the utmost importance: location, location, location. On Voilknetwork, those things are: reputation, reputation, reputation. It’s not to say other variables aren’t important, but reputation will be an enormous factor in your level of success.Many Voilkians glance at users’ reputation scores when deciding which articles to read because they know higher reputation scores means it is much more likely quality content. Furthermore, the higher your rep, the more effect your vote will have on the reputation of others.It is worth noting that if your reputation score goes below 0, Voilknetwork will hide your posts and comments making it very difficult to gain monetary rewards and followers. This incentivizes online etiquette and respect for your fellow Voilkians."],
    ["What is Revoilking?", "This is like reblogging or sharing posts on other platforms. Once you revoilk a post it will appear in your feed and in your followers' feeds as if you had posted it yourself. Use it conservatively and with caution. It is great to want to share content you like and appreciate with people you follow, but you don't want to overwhelm your followers either."],
    ["Can I share on other social media?", "Yes you can use the share button to share on Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn. You are welcome to post your Voilknetwork links on other websites and social media sites."],
    ["What is a blockchain?", "A blockchain is a public ledger of all transactions ever executed. All of the transactions and data are stored in a distributed database. Each time the database is updated, all of updates are done together in a batch called a 'block'. Each time a new block is produced/added, it is appended on to all of the previous blocks - hence the name blockchain."],
    ["What is the Voilk blockchain?", "The Voilk blockchain is the publicly accessible distributed database, which records all posts and votes, and distributes the rewards across the network. It is where all of the text content and voting data is stored, and it is where all of the reward calculations and payouts are performed."],
    ["How does bandwidth work on the Voilk blockchain?", "Since transacting on the Voilk blockchain has zero fees, bandwidth rate-limiting is employed to safeguard the blockchain from spam attacks. Everything action that you take on the blockchain will consume a small amount of bandwidth. This includes posting, commenting, voting, transferring tokens, etc. Viewing content does not consume bandwidth. Every user has a limited amount of bandwidth to use each week. The more transactions a user does, the less bandwidth they will have left (until it recharges). Users with more Voilk Power will have a higher bandwidth allowance. Normally everyone's bandwidth allowance is quite high, and users are able to use the network freely without any interruptions. Sometimes when the blockchain becomes busy however (due to heavy use), everyone's individual allowances may go down until the network becomes less busy. You can check how much bandwidth you currently have based on the current limit at: https://explorer.voilk.com/@youraccount If users are below their bandwidth limit, they will be unable to transact with the blockchain until their bandwidth recharges or their limit is raised. If you get an error that you have exceeded your bandwidth allowance, it is normally best to just wait and try again later (when it is less busy). Usually if you wait and try again later, the transaction will likley go through. If you are unable to transact for extended periods of time, or you are frequently running into bandwidth limits, then you will either need to reduce your usage to stay within your limit, or purchase more Voilk Power for your account."],
    ["What is the difference between Voilk and Voilk Network?", "Voilk is the name of the blockchain that stores all of the data and transactions, and processes all of the events that take place. VOILK is also a name for the system’s value token (currency). Voilknetwork is a front end web interface to interact with the blockchain, and view the blockchain data. Voilknetwork is also the name of the company that owns and operates the website voilk.com"],
    ["How is Voilk different from Bitcoin?", "On a technical level, the two networks rely on the same model of a blockchain, but are built upon different technologies and codebase. Voilk is based on a new state-of-the-art blockchain technology called Graphene, which uses 'witnesses' instead of 'miners' to produce blocks. The 'delegated proof of stake' model of using witnesses instead of miners allows for greater efficiency in block production. With BTC, 100% of the new coins that are created are allocated to block producers (miners). With the Voilk blockchain, only 15% of the new coins are paid to block producers (witnesses). The other 85% of new VOILK coins are awarded to content producers, curators, and Voilk Power holders."],
    ["What is the difference between Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, and Delegated Proof of Stake?", "Proof of work - Miners solve a complex mathematical problem. The miner that solves the problem first adds the block to the blockchain. The network rewards the miner for doing so. Proof of stake - Requires ownership, or stake, in the cryptocurrency. The more tokens you own, the more block creation power you have. Benefits: eliminates the need for expensive mining rigs, runs on a tiny fraction of the power, and it requires block producers to have a stake in the network. Delegated proof of stake - Block-creating accounts, called witnesses, are collectively approved by Voilk stakeholders. Instead of relying on proof of work to find blocks, the Voilk network actively schedules these accounts to improve the time between blocks to 3 seconds."],
    ["How often does the Voilk blockchain produce a new block?", "The Voilk blockchain schedules witnesses to produce a new block every 3 seconds. 21 witness nodes produce 21 blocks in each 63-second round."],
    ["Can I mine VOILK?", "You can yes, if you have sufficient knowledge on how to work with VOILK nodes, and how to run a witness node for the network, that's how you can earn witness rewards, you can also call them mining rewards."],
    ["Who is the Founder of Voilk?", "Bilal Haider (https://voilk.com/@bilal) is the Founder of Voilk Project."],
    ["Am I allowed to use the Voilk and Voilk logos?", "You are free to use, any voilk projects but you cannot use the logos for your own projects. since they represent the company uniquely on the internet."],
    ["Did Voilk 'pre-mine' tokens?", "Yes, there were about 20 Million VSD and 10 Million VOILK tokens premined."],
    ["Why were the tokens premined?", "To provide users with stable value of VSD against USD, a decent amount of VSD coins was premined. So that you can always get exactly 1 USD against your 1 VSD. There are maintanence costs involved in running the network, for that purpose 10 million VOILK tokens were premined which we will sell to users without hurting the value too much. periodically"],
    ["VSD can be produced on demand?", "Since voilk is also a bank, VSD can be printed on demand, so if you wish to run a deposit/withdrawal service for people in your country, you can place an order to print VSD and we can print them for you. You can choose your own deposit and withdrawal fees for your customers."],

    ["How can I keep my Voilk account secure?", "Save your master password and keep it somewhere safe. Only log into your account using the key with the appropriate permissions for what you are doing: Posting key for every day logins Active key when necessary for transfers, power ups, etc. Master password or owner key when changing the password Again, save your master password and keep it safe! If logging in with your post key, make sure you don't overwrite or misplace your original master password.It is not recommended to share your password or keys with any third party site"],
    ["Why should I be careful with my master password?", "The master password is used to derive all keys for your account, including the owner key. If someone has access to your master password, they can steal your account and all of the tokens in it."],
    ["Why is the master password a long string of gibberish?", "The password has to be long and random for maximum account security."],
    ["What are my different keys for?", "Posting key - The posting key allows accounts to post, comment, edit, vote, revoilk, and follow or mute other accounts. Most users should be logging into Voilknetwork every day with the posting key. You are more likely to have your password or key compromised the more you use it so a limited posting key exists to restrict the damage that a compromised account key would cause. Active key - The active key is meant for more sensitive tasks such as transferring funds, power up/down transactions, converting Voilk Dollars, voting for witnesses, updating profile details and avatar, and placing a market order. Memo key - Currently the memo key is not used. Owner key - The owner key is only meant for use when necessary. It is the most powerful key because it can change any key of an account, including the owner key. Ideally it is meant to be stored offline, and only used to recover a compromised account."],
    ["What do I do if I lost my password/keys?", "There is no way to recover your account if you lose your password or owner key! Because your account has real value, it is very important that you save your master password somewhere safe where you will not lose it. It is strongly recommended that you store an offline copy of your password somewhere safe in case of a hard drive failure or other calamity. Consider digital offline storage, such as an external disk or flash drive, as well as printed paper. Use a safe deposit box for best redundancy."],
    ["Are my VOILK and Voilk Dollar tokens insured in the event of a hack or if someone takes over my account?", "No, liquid tokens can not be taken back if stolen or sent to the wrong account. If your tokens are in Voilk Power, it is impossible for a hacker to take out more than 1/365 per day. If your tokens are in savings, there is a three-day wait period for them to become transferable."],

    ["What is available for developers interested in Voilk?", "There are documents available to give them a start, but you should be able to work it out"],
    ["What are Voilk witnesses?", "The Voilk blockchain requires a set of people to create blocks and uses a consensus mechanism called delegated proof of stake, or DPOS. The community elects 'witnesses' to act as the network's block producers and governance body. There are 20 full-time witnesses, producing a block every 63-second round. A 21st position is shared by the backup witnesses, who are scheduled proportionally to the amount of stake-weighted community approval they have. Witnesses are compensated with Voilk Power for each block they create."],
    ["How can I vote for witnesses?", "You should always look for how witnesses are contributing the project overall. choose to only for those who are actively contributing, avoid voting for those who are just there to claim the rewards. Visit https://voilk.com/~witnesses."],
